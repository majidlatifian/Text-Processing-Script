# Text Processing Script

This script takes user input, removes the vowels (a, e, i, o, u), and adds periods between the remaining characters. The modified text is then printed to the console.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the desired text.
3. The modified text will be displayed.

Feel free to improve or modify the script as needed.
